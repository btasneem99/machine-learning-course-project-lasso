You will be submiting an entry to Kaggle's [House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/){target="_blank"} by fitting a fitted ~~spline~~, ~~multiple regression~~ LASSO regularized multiple regression model $\hat{f}(x)$.

However of the original 1460 rows of the `training` data, in the `data/` folder you are given a `train.csv` consisting of only 50 of the rows!


***

# Load data

Read in data provided by Kaggle for this competition. They are organized in the `data/` folder of this RStudio project:

```{r}
training <- read_csv("data/train.csv") %>% 
  rename(
    FirstFlrSF = `1stFlrSF`,
    SecondFlrSF = `2ndFlrSF`,
    ThirdSsnPorch = `3SsnPorch`
  ) %>% 
  # Fit your models to this outcome variable:
  mutate(log_SalePrice = log(SalePrice+1))

test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")%>% 
  rename(
    FirstFlrSF = `1stFlrSF`,
    SecondFlrSF = `2ndFlrSF`,
    ThirdSsnPorch = `3SsnPorch`
  )
sample_submission <- read_csv("data/sample_submission.csv")

# Function that takes in a LASSO fit object and returns a "tidy" data frame of
# the beta-hat coefficients for each lambda value used in LASSO fit. 
get_LASSO_coefficients <- function(LASSO_fit){
  beta_hats <- LASSO_fit %>%
    broom::tidy(return_zeros = TRUE) %>%
    select(term, estimate, lambda) %>%
    arrange(desc(lambda))
  return(beta_hats)
}
```


## Look at your data!

Always, ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** start by looking at your raw data. This gives you visual sense of what information you have to help build your predictive models. To get a full description of each variable, read the data dictionary in the `data_description.txt` file in the `data/` folder.

Note that the following code chunk has `eval = FALSE` meaning "don't evaluate this chunk with knitting" because `.Rmd` files won't knit if they include a `View()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(training)
glimpse(training)

View(test)
glimpse(test)

# Pay close attention to the variables and variable types in sample_submission. 
# Your submission must match this exactly.
glimpse(sample_submission)

# Hint:
skim(training)
skim(test)

#imputed_Data <- mice(training,m=1,maxit=5,meth='pmm',seed=500)
#completedData <- complete(imputed_Data,1)

```

## Data wrangling

# Minimally viable product

Since we have already performed exploratory data analyses of this data in MP1 and MP2, let's jump straight into the modeling. For this phase:

* Train an unregularized standard multiple regression model $\widehat{f}_1$ using **all** 36 numerical variables as predictors.


```{r}
# Train your model here:

# Model formula
model_formula <- "log_SalePrice ~ MSSubClass + LotFrontage + LotArea + 
OverallQual + OverallCond + YearBuilt + YearRemodAdd + MasVnrArea + BsmtFinSF1 + 
BsmtFinSF2 + BsmtUnfSF + TotalBsmtSF + FirstFlrSF + SecondFlrSF + LowQualFinSF + 
GrLivArea + BsmtFullBath + BsmtHalfBath + FullBath + HalfBath + BedroomAbvGr + 
KitchenAbvGr + TotRmsAbvGrd + Fireplaces + GarageYrBlt + GarageCars + GarageArea + 
WoodDeckSF + OpenPorchSF + EnclosedPorch + ThirdSsnPorch + ScreenPorch + PoolArea + 
MiscVal + MoSold + YrSold" %>% 
  as.formula()

#fit model to train data 
fitted_model <- lm(model_formula, data = train)


```



***



# Due diligence

* Compute two RMLSE's of the fitted model $\widehat{f}_1$
      a) on the `training` data. You may use a function from a package to achieve this.
      b) on the `test` data via a submission to Kaggle `data/submit_regression.csv`.
* Compare the two RMLSE's. If they are different, comment on why they might be different.

```{r}

#compute RMLSE on train data : 

#Make predictions using train data 
predicted_points_1 <- fitted_model %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = train)

#Save predictions in train data frame
train <- train %>% 
    mutate( logSalePrice_hat = predicted_points_1$.fitted,
      SalePrice_hat = (exp(logSalePrice_hat)-1))

#calculate RMLSE 
rmsle(train$SalePrice, train$SalePrice_hat)


#compute RMLSE on test data : 

#Make predictions using testing data 
predicted_points_2 <- fitted_model %>%
    broom::augment(newdata = testing)

#Save predictions in testing data frame
testing <- testing %>% 
    mutate( logSalePrice_hat = predicted_points_2$.fitted,
      SalePrice_hat = (exp(logSalePrice_hat)-1))

RMLSE on training  | RMLSE on test (via Kaggle)
------------------ | -------------
0.0476             | 0.225


The RMLSE on the training data is 0.476 and the RMLSE on the test data (from Kaggle submission) is 0.225. The RMLSE on the test data is approximately 5 times bigger. Because our training data consist of only 50 observations, the model is overfitted to the test data. Hence, when we fit the model on the training data, we get an error which is much larger.

# Reaching for the stars

1. Find the $\lambda^*$ tuning parameter that yields the LASSO model with the
lowest estimated RMLSE as well as this lowest RMLSE as well. You may use functions included in a package for this.
1. Convince yourself with a visualization that the $\lambda^*$ you found is indeed the one that returns the lowest estimated RMLSE.
1. What is the model $\widehat{f}$_2 resulting from this $\lambda^*$? Output a data frame of the $\widehat{\beta}$.
1. Visualize the progression of $\widehat{\beta}$ for different $\lambda$ values and mark $\lambda^*$ with a vertical line:

1. Compare the two RMLSE's. If they are different, comment on why they might be different.

Comparing both RMLSE's here:

Method           | RMLSE on training  | RMLSE on test (via Kaggle)
---------------- | ------------------ | -------------
Unregularized lm | 0.0476             | 0.225
LASSO            | 0.0835             | 0.198


As lambda increases, the beta-hat goes towards zero because as LASSO’s lambda coefficient increases, it increasingly regularizes the existing multiple regression model until all we are left with are the intercepts of the model for each predictor.

The RMLSE on training data for the LASSO model is larger (approximately 2x) than the RMLSE of the unregularized lm model on training data. The reason why this occurs is because LASSO has shrunk the beta coefficients of variables and has even dropped several variables from the model by shrinking them to 0. This means that compared to the unregularized lm model, the LASSO model is less overfitted. Because it reduces overfitting on the training data, the RMLSE on the training data is larger for the LASSO model.

The RMLSE on test data for the LASSO model is smaller than the RMLSE of the unregularizd lm model on test data. When we fit a LASSO model on the training data, we reduce overfitting. Hence, the predictions that we make on the test data are more accurate as compared to the predictions we make using the unregularized lm model. As the accuracy increases, the error of our predictions on test data decreases. Therefore, the RMLSE on test data when we use a LASSO model is smaller.
